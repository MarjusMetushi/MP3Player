# MP3Player
**This is a lightweight and simple Java MP3 Player GUI that uses both internal and external libraries.
<br>
This project contains two external libraries (jar files) javazoom JLayer (http://www.javazoom.net/javalayer/javalayer.html) and MP3agic (https://github.com/mpatric/mp3agic) and the other libraries are built-in libraries.
<br>
I used JLayer to decode and play MP3 files. This is a Java library that allows high-quality playbacks for an mp3 file. 
<br>
I also used MP3agic to read MP3 files. MP3agic is a straightforward API that allows users to manage song information.
<br>
The project is straightforward to understand due to its simple interface.
<br>
Below I shared screenshots of the project running, selecting a song or playlist, and playing music.
<br>
The project contains the basic features of an MP3 but is still in development.
<br>
This project is not yet fully developed and it's in development.**
